The goal of this assignment is to understand and implement basic concurrency in Go. 
You will write a program that concurrently downloads a set of images from given URLs and saves them to disk. 
By comparing the time taken to download images sequentially vs. concurrently, you will observe the benefits of concurrency 
for I/O-bound tasks.
